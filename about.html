		I’m so glad you’re here! Very little gives me more joy than hearing what lights up others’ lives. When asked for one of my classes to find and index a collection of 100 objects or concepts, I decided to survey 100 people anonymously and ask them to describe something they treasured. Answers fit into one of four categories: <span id="actYellow">Actions</span>—such as playing music, <span id="shipRed">relationships</span> they had with others—either people or pets, <span id="itemGreen">physical objects</span> with significance—like a gift, or <span id="conBlue">abstract concepts </span>—such as love or art. These responses, in fitting with the “treasure” theme, were originally collected into a deck of cards and presented within a box, playing off the idea of a treasure chest.  </p>
		<p class="bodyCopy">But now for fun I’ve made them into a website! I add new responses whenever I can, normally at least once a week!</p>

<h1 class="bHead" id="itemGreen"> About Me</h1>
<p class="bodyCopy">
	Most of the time, I like to make work with elements where they don’t belong—like people underwater, fish in space, ghosts hiking, or people diving into their fish tanks! But I always like to create work which makes me happy. A lot of the time, that means storytelling, like adding characters and illustrating alluring scenes. In my design, that desire to find joy in my work often comes through in the subject matter. I make money for zombies, manifestos of self forgiveness, and now I hoard the things that give people joy.

	<p class="bodyCopy">I’m currently a sophomore student studying Communications Design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. When I’m not in Brooklyn, you’re likely to find me in my hometown just outside of Boston (or in the middle of nowhere!). </p>
